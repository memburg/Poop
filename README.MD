# 💩.js
*Not another s\*\*\*\*y JavaScript library...*

## What is 💩.js?
💩.js (/puːp ˈdʒeɪ ɛs/) is an attempt to write less code in JavaScript, it is a tiny library with a short version of most commonly used functions in JavaScript.

## Functions
A variety of commonly used functions:
- ```console.log()``` is now ```puts([])```
- ```console.clear()``` is now ```clc()```

```Math``` methods are now functions:
- ```abs(x)``` returns the absolute value of a number
- ```acos(x)``` returns the arccosine of a number
- ```acosh(x)``` returns the hyperbolic arccosine of a number
- ```asin(x)``` returns the arcsine of a number
- ```asinh(x)``` returns the hyperbolic arcsine of a number
- ```atan(x)``` returns the arctangent of a number
- ```atanh(x)``` returns the hyperbolic arctangent of a number
- ```atan2(x, y)``` returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments
- ```cbrt(x)``` returns the cube root of a number
- ```ceil(x)``` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number
- ```clz32(x)``` returns the number of leading zeroes of a 32-bit integer
- ```cos(x)``` returns the cosine of a number
- ```cosh(x)``` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number
- ```exp(x)``` returns ```E^x```, where ```x``` is the argument, and ```E``` is Euler's constant
- ```expm1(x)``` returns subtracting ```1``` from ```exp(x)```
- ```floor(x)``` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number
- ```fround(x)``` returns the nearest single precision float representation of a number
- ```imul(x, y)``` returns the result of a 32-bit integer multiplication
- ```log(x)``` returns the natural logarithm of a number
- ```log1p(x)``` returns  the natural logarithm of ```1 + x``` for a number
- ```log10(x)``` returns the base 10 logarithm of a number
- ```log2(x)``` returns the base 2 logarithm of a number
- ```pow(x, y)``` returns base to the exponent power, that is, ```x^y```
- ```random()``` returns a pseudo-random number between ```0``` and ```1```
- ```round(x)``` returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer
- ```sign(x)``` returns the sign of the ```x```, indicating whether ```x``` is positive, negative, or zero
- ```sin(x)``` returns the sine of a number
- ```sinh(x)``` returns the hyperbolic sine of a number
- ```sqrt(x)``` returns the positive square root of a number
- ```tan(x)``` returns the tangent of a number
- ```tanh(x)``` returns the hyperbolic tangent of a number
- ```trunc(x)``` returns the integer part of the number ```x```, removing any fractional digits

## Constants
- ```E 			= 2.718...```
- ```LN2 		= 0.693...```
- ```LN10 		= 2.302...```
- ```LOG2E 		= 1.442...```

- ```LOG10E 	= 0.434...```
- ```SQRT1_2 	= 0.707...```
- ```SQRT2 		= 1.414...```

Other constants:
